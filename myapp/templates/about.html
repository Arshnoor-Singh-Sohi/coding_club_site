    <section class="history">
        <p>
            Founded in 2018 by a group of enthusiastic students, 
            the University Coding Club has grown into a vibrant community 
            of coders, developers, and tech-enthusiasts. Our mission is to 
            foster collaboration, skill sharing, and innovation through 
            various events and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, we've hosted numerous workshops, hackathons, 
            hack-nights, and career panels. Our alumni have gone on to 
            work at top tech companies, startups, and research labs. 
            The club is open to all majorsâ€”if you have an interest in 
            coding, there's a place for you here.
